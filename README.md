# Online appendix for the paper submission: How is Performance Addressed in DevOps? A Survey on Industrial Practices
Testing and analyzing performance has challenged researchers and practitioners in classic environments for many years. 
Now, with the increased popularity of the DevOps practices, handling performance has become even more challenging.
As deploying every day, minute, or every couple of seconds is becoming the new normal, performance analysis is often left out, as the requirements for a holistic performance evaluation are hard to fulfill in fast and automated delivery pipelines. 
In the past months, we questioned IT and DevOps experts and collected insights into their IT management focusing on performance of applications. 
In this work, we present the results of this survey and draw conclusions for modern DevOps performance management,
